%Cibi ZongYu data collection
%Sai Gogineni annotation

This work would not have been possible without the support and continuous advice of Dr. Tsai. The structure and organization of his team made this work a reality, by providing high quality data and the needed hardware to set up the experiments. A special thanks to Dr. Kira, who made this thesis possible, and gave me some precious advice. My only regret is not to have asked more question to him.

We also want to thank particularly Cibi Pranav, Ryan Salameh and Zhongyu Yang for the data they collected during their various trip around Georgia and neighboring states. As well as a great thanks to Sai Gogineni, who annotated by himself all $652,321$ frames collected, creating the dataset we used during this study.

Thanks to Cindy for proofreading most of this work and for her continuous support.
